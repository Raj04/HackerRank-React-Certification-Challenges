# HackerRank React Challenge #2

###### The codebase was not cloneable, but the below hints will surely help you to understand the problem and implement the solution as well

---

##### The task includes below functionality to implement

- The given array of objects, where each object has three properties, they were title, date and upvotes
- First task was to render array of objects to the UI
  - Maintain a state to pre-populate the array of objects, render this to the UI with the help of map iteration to each object property.
- Second task was to sort the table items when we click on the sort by upvote button
  - Maintain a handleclick for the sortByUpvote button
  - Whenever we click on handleClick, sort the array of object by property of no of upvotes
  - set the new updated object to the state maintained to render array of objects
- Third task was to sort the table when user clicks on sortByDate
  - Maintain a handleclick for the sortByDate button
  - Whenever we click on handleClick, sort the array of object by property of no of upvotes
  - set the new updated object to the state maintained to render array of objects
- The main task is the last two, which is to sort the array of object by some property, this can be done by using any library like Underscore, they allow installing them as well, but you will get more clarity if we write our own sorting mechanism

###### Hope the above hints helps you and enjoy the learning from the challenge
